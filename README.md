## Overview

Asteroids is a classic arcade game where players control a triangular spaceship and navigate through an asteroid-filled cosmos. Your goal is simple: survive, earn points by destroying asteroids, and avoid collisions.

From Wikipedia:
> Asteroids is a space-themed multidirectional shooter arcade video game designed by Lyle Rains and Ed Logg released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a single spaceship in an asteroid field which is periodically traversed by flying saucers. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either, or being hit by the saucers' counter-fire. The game becomes harder as the number of asteroids increases.

## Features

Asteroids is a classic arcade game, updated with modern enhancements and developed in Rust. This project serves as an exercise in deploying Rust code to the web through WebAssembly. Here's what you can anticipate in this version:

- **Classic Gameplay**: Enjoy the timeless gameplay of the original Asteroids arcade game.
- **Retro-Inspired Graphics**: Experience the nostalgia of classic arcade visuals with a modern twist such as procedurally generated asteroids and particle effects.
- **Keyboard, Mouse and Touch Controls**: Control your spaceship with ease using keyboard inputs, mouse or touch controls. 
- **WebAssembly (Wasm) Compatibility**: Play directly in your web browser.

While paying homage to the original classic there's are a few features I'm still fine-tuning:

- **Silent Cosmos:** Currently, the game is without sound effects or music, allowing you to focus on the raw gameplay experience.
- ~**Saucers on Standby:** The elusive enemy saucers are yet to make their appearance, but beware; they might sneak up on you in future updates!~ (now added)
- ~**No Hyperspace Shortcut:** Unfortunately, the hyperspace escape is temporarily disabled. You'll have to rely on your piloting skills to navigate the asteroid field.~ (now added)

However, despite these minor setbacks, it remains faithful to the core gameplay that made Asteroids legendary.

**Note:** The game uses the Hyperspace font. **Hyperspace Â© (Neale Davidson). 2012-2015. All Rights Reserved.**

## Ready to Embark?

Here's a quick guide on how to navigate through the cosmic challenges:

1. **Lives:** You start with 3 lives. These represent your chances to conquer the asteroid field.

2. **Your Arsenal:** You control a spaceship equipped with a powerful cannon. Use it wisely!

3. **Asteroid Annihilation:** Your primary mission is to eliminate the asteroids drifting through space. When you shoot an asteroid, it breaks down into smaller pieces. Keep shooting the smaller ones until they disappear.

4. **Wave Progression:** To advance to the next wave, you must clear all the asteroids on the screen. As you progress, the game becomes more challenging, with larger and faster asteroids.

5. **Avoid Collisions:** Be cautious! Colliding with asteroids costs you a precious life. Dodge and weave to stay alive.

6. **High Score:** Aim for the stars! Achieve the highest score possible. Every asteroid destroyed brings you closer to glory.

7. **Game Over:** Exhaust all your lives, and your cosmic journey comes to an end. But don't worry, you can always start a new game and aim for an even higher score.
